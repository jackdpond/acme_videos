This is a repo to store and collaboratively create and edit manim videos created by the 2026 BYU ACME cohort.

The idea is to create engaging and intuitive math videos using manim to cement our own understanding of difficult concepts and to aid the understanding of future ACME cohorts. This repo will house in-process and finished scripts for videos, as well code for the math videos. It will be a sandbox for the creation of great content, and the archive where anybody can read the scripts or examine the code for the videos.
